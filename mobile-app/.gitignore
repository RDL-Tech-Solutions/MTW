# Dependencies
node_modules/
.pnp
.pnp.js

# Expo
.expo/
web-build/

# Native
ios/
android/
# Note: If you have ejected or are using bare workflow, you might want to remove ios/ and android/ from here. 
# But for managed expo (which this seems to be based on structure), it is often cleaner to ignore them if they are generated. 
# However, usually with 'prebuild' they are committed. 
# Given the user says "cache files", I will definitely ignore node_modules and .expo.
# I'll keep ios/android commented out or standard. A standard "managed" project doesn't even have them.
# If they exist, they are usually source.
# Let's stick to cache files.
